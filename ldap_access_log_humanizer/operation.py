    # 49 / 52e  AD_INVALID CREDENTIALS  Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext error, which is returned when the username is valid but the combination of password and user credential is invalid. This is the AD equivalent of LDAP error code 49.

    # 49 / 530  NOT_PERMITTED_TO_LOGON_AT_THIS_TIME   Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error that is logon failure caused because the user is not permitted to log on at this time. Returns only when presented with a valid username and valid password credential.
    # 49 / 531  RESTRICTED_TO_SPECIFIC_MACHINES   Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error that is logon failure caused because the user is not permitted to log on from this computer. Returns only when presented with a valid username and valid password credential.
    # 49 / 532  PASSWORD_EXPIRED  Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error that is a logon failure. The specified account password has expired. Returns only when presented with valid username and password credential.
    # 49 / 533  ACCOUNT_DISABLED  Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error that is a logon failure. The account is currently disabled. Returns only when presented with valid username and password credential.
    # 49 / 568  ERROR_TOO_MANY_CONTEXT_IDS  Indicates that during a log-on attempt, the user's security context accumulated too many security IDs. This is an issue with the specific LDAP user object/account which should be investigated by the LDAP administrator.
    # 49 / 701  ACCOUNT_EXPIRED   Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error that is a logon failure. The user's account has expired. Returns only when presented with valid username and password credential.
    # 49 / 773  USER MUST RESET PASSWORD  Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext data error. The user's password must be changed before logging on the first time. Returns only when presented with valid user-name and password credential.
    # Indicates that the caller does not have sufficient rights to perform the requested operation.
    50: "LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS",
    # Indicates that the LDAP server is too busy to process the client request at this time but if the client waits and resubmits the request, the server may be able to process it then.

    # Need to sort out above before adding this
    # 52e   AD_INVALID CREDENTIALS  Indicates an Active Directory(AD) AcceptSecurityContext error, which is returned when the username is valid but the combination of password and user credential is invalid. This is the AD equivalent of LDAP error code 49: LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS.
    # Indicates that the LDAP server cannot process the request because of server-defined restrictions. This error is returned for the following reasons: The add entry request violates the server's structure rules...OR...The modify attribute request specifies attributes that users cannot modify...OR...Password restrictions prevent the action...OR...Connection restrictions prevent the action.
    53: "LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM",
    # Indicates that the client discovered an alias or referral loop, and is thus unable to complete this request.
    54: "LDAP_LOOP_DETECT",
    # Indicates that the add or modify DN operation violates the schema's structure rules. For example, The request places the entry subordinate to an alias. The request places the entry subordinate to a container that is forbidden by the containment rules. The RDN for the entry uses a forbidden attribute type.
    64: "LDAP_NAMING_VIOLATION",
    65: "LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION",  # Indicates that the add, modify, or modify DN operation violates the object class rules for the entry. For example, the following types of request return this error: The add or modify operation tries to add an entry without a value for a required attribute. The add or modify operation tries to add an entry with a value for an attribute which the class definition does not contain. The modify operation tries to remove a required attribute without removing the auxiliary class that defines the attribute as required.
    # Indicates that the requested operation is permitted only on leaf entries. For example, the following types of requests return this error: The client requests a delete operation on a parent entry. The client request a modify DN operation on a parent entry.
    66: "LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF",
    # Indicates that the modify operation attempted to remove an attribute value that forms the entry's relative distinguished name.
    67: "LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN",
    # Indicates that the add operation attempted to add an entry that already exists, or that the modify operation attempted to rename an entry to the name of an entry that already exists.

    # Indicates that the modify operation attempted to modify the structure rules of an object class.
    69: "LDAP_NO_OBJECT_CLASS_MODS",
    # Reserved for CLDAP.
    70: "LDAP_RESULTS_TOO_LARGE",
